# C-library

In this project I wrote my own versions of standard C functions as well as add other usefull functions. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and is used in several later projects in the curriculum.

ft_ stands for *f*orty*t*wo

## Functions

- memory management
- printing
- string manipulation
- string-to-number and number-to-string

## Allowed external functions

- malloc, free, write (limited to specific ft_* functions)

## Technologies Used

- `C`, `Makefile`, `Git`

## What I learned

- understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and how these essential operations work under the hood   
- learning to think about edge cases while writing a function   
- writing usefull comments \ documenting code
